2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/waleedahmad4015/simple-counter-program.git
   ```

## File Structure

```
simple-counter/
│
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── README.md
```

## How It Works

The counter program uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and update the counter value based on user interactions. The HTML provides the structure, the CSS styles the appearance, and the JavaScript handles the functionality.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the styles in `styles.css` to change the appearance of the counter and buttons. You can also extend the functionality by editing the `script.js` file.
